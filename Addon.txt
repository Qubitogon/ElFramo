[12:58 AM] Qubit: bit of a random question, but does someone know whether raidframe addons generally update the information frames show through onUpdate scripts (throttled maybe) or do they tend to go by combatlog events?
[12:59 AM] Kaminaris: that depends on raidframe addons
[1:01 AM] Simpy: tbh neither, mode use actual events
[1:01 AM] Simpy: onupdate and combatlog is too excessive for that
[1:02 AM] Qubit: Is that so. What do people use to update their frames then if you dont mind me asking?
[1:03 AM] Kaminaris: your question is too broad
[1:04 AM] Kaminaris: and i doubt we have someone who is familiar with every possible implementation out there
[1:06 AM] Qubit: I mostly wanted to make sure Im not missing an obvious way to do it that's better than either on combatlogevents or throttled onUpdates
[1:06 AM] Kaminaris: what do you want to do?
[1:06 AM] Simpy: with events
[1:06 AM] Kaminaris: make your own unitframes addon?
[1:07 AM] Qubit: yeah I currently have a fully functional raidframe addon Im just trying to optimise it, and boy does it need it
[1:07 AM] rivers: pretty much everything that a unitframe will track has an associated UNIT_SOMETHING event
[1:07 AM] Kaminaris: then it depends on what are you trying to have visible
[1:07 AM] rivers: health, power, absorb amount, buffs and debuffs, threat, you name it
[1:07 AM] Kaminaris: simplest implementation is just health
[1:08 AM] rivers: oh, and you can use RegisterUnitEvent to make sure that each unit frame only responds to the unit it is tracking
[1:09 AM] Qubit: okay yeah guess I'll just have to try it like that and compare
[1:09 AM] Qubit: doing it onUpdate did feel barbaric but I guess I had hopes
[1:09 AM] Qubit: thanks ^^
[1:09 AM] Kaminaris: you might as well gather data in events
[1:09 AM] rivers: i would note that with some events (UNIT_AURA in particular) you can get spammed with events on semi-rare occasions
[1:09 AM] Kaminaris: and then throttle updates(edited)
[1:10 AM] rivers: more than one event before the frame is redrawn
[1:10 AM] rivers: for these, it can be a good idea to use a combination of OnUpdate and OnEvent
[1:10 AM] Qubit: so you'd probably queue them right
[1:10 AM] Simpy: there are very few cases were onupdate is the right option
[1:10 AM] rivers: but this is relatively rare
[1:11 AM] Kaminaris: ex. keep unit data in array, populate it in events
[1:11 AM] Kaminaris: redraw each 0.Xs
[1:12 AM] Simpy: lua doesnt have arrays :murloc:
murloc2
[1:12 AM] Qubit: kek
[1:12 AM] Qubit: thanks for the help, hopefully I wont kill myself trying to rewrite half my code :D
[1:12 AM] Kaminaris: it does, they are just named tables :stuck_out_tongue:
[1:13 AM] rivers: tables aren't really arrays tho
[1:13 AM] Simpy: @Kaminaris wannafite :murloc:
[1:13 AM] Kaminaris: depends on definiton of arrays. :stuck_out_tongue:
[1:14 AM] Simpy: most everything in unitframes can be handled with actual events it's def the way to go, compare to how ouf does it
[1:14 AM] Simpy: ouf is a decent framework for unitframes
[1:19 AM] Qubit: I'll give it a read :ok_hand::skin-tone-3:
[1:19 AM] Simpy: goodluck!
[1:19 AM] Qubit: thanks
